//  console.log(name); 
//     var name;
// 4)What is temperal Dead Zone
// Ans->Temporal Dead Zone is the period of time during which the let and const declarations cannot be accessed.
// Temporal Dead Zone starts when the code execution enters the block which contains the let or const declaration
// and continues until the declaration has executed. Ex:

//   {
//       area of block (let & Const)
//       }
// 5)What is the Difference between == & === Operator ?
// Ans->Both are comparison operators. The difference between both the
// operators is that,“==” compares values only whereas,“ === “ is
//  compares both value and datatypes.
 
// var x="8";
// var y=8;
// console.log(x==y);   It returns true 
// console.log(x===y);   It returns false
